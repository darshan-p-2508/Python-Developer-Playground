"""
Turtle Race Game

This script simulates a turtle race where the user can bet on which turtle will win based on color. 
The race continues until one turtle crosses the finish line, and the result is displayed, showing whether 
the user won or lost based on their bet.

Features:
- User input prompts for betting on a turtle color.
- Random movement of turtles along the x-axis.
- Interactive screen with graphical feedback using the turtle module.

Modules used:
- turtle: For creating graphical turtles and setting up the screen.
- random: For generating random distances for each turtle's movement.

Game Flow:
1. The screen is set up with specific dimensions.
2. The user is prompted to enter their bet (color of turtle).
3. Turtles are created, positioned, and assigned colors.
4. The race begins and continues until a turtle crosses the finish line.
5. If the winning turtle matches the user's bet, they win; otherwise, they lose.
6. The game waits for a mouse click to close the screen after the race concludes.
